In the beginning of 2015, I've built a small dinghy – an [ Eastport Nesting Pram](http://www.clcboats.com/shop/boats/wooden-sailboat-kits/eastport-pram/eastport-nesting-dinghy.html) by [Chesapeake Light Craft](http://www.clcboats.com/) –  out of plywood and epoxy resin.

Currently I'm building a sailing yacht from the same materials. For that I've scaled down my job so that I only have to work 4 days per week. Fridays are for boat building (and a bit of the weekend).

## The Boat

The boat is a [Mini 6.50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Transat_6.50), ocean-going, 6.50m long and 3m wide. It planes very easily, which means it can go a lot faster than its hull speed. By adding a 2.50m long bowsprit, the boat effectively becomes 8m long, which means it can carry a crazy amount of sail area. It's an extreme boat, designed for racing and fun. Not your average cruiser.

## Progress

At the time of writing (September 2016), I'm assembling the hull, which is currently upside down. As soon as that's compete, I can paint it, turn it around and start working on the interior.

The plan is to get the boat into the water in spring 2018.

I'm using a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/uwbur9lh/boat-building) to track my progress.

## Videos

I'm documenting the build process on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVMAbol8WFY2G8kvdy48nIg), explaining what I do, what the problems are and how I overcome them. I think I'm the first to do that with a project this size – at least I haven't found anyone else so far.

## Cost

I'm also documenting how much money I'm spending on the whole process. Since I didn't have any tools before, I had to buy everything. I've also rented a shed in Berlin, which costs me ~€280 per month.

All expenses are in [a Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ar92kaFryLaiSyvQbA11Mjp_Mdu69UG-MyL4m1TWva8/edit?usp=sharing).
