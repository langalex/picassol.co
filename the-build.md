In the beginning of 2015, I've built a small dinghy – an [ Eastport Nesting Pram](http://www.clcboats.com/shop/boats/wooden-sailboat-kits/eastport-pram/eastport-nesting-dinghy.html) by [Chesapeake Light Craft](http://www.clcboats.com/) –  out of plywood and epoxy resin.

Currently I'm building a small sailing yacht from the same materials. For that I've scaled down my job so that I only have to work 4 days per week. Fridays are for boat building (and a bit of the weekend).

## The Boat

The boat is a [Mini 6.50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Transat_6.50), ocean-going, 6.50m long and 3m wide. It planes very easily, which means it can go a lot faster than its hull speed. By adding a 2.50m long bowsprit, the boat effectively becomes 8m long, which means it can carry a crazy amount of sail area. It's an extreme boat, design for racing and fun. Not your average cruiser.

## Progress

At the time of writing (April 2015) I'm waiting for my kit to arrive - the kit includes pre-cut bulkheads, which makes it easier to build the boat, than if I had to build everything from scratch.

The plan is to start building as soon as the kit arrives, and to get the boat into the water in spring 2017.

I'm using a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/uwbur9lh/boat-building) to track my progress.

## Videos

I'm documenting the build process in shortish video clips published on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVMAbol8WFY2G8kvdy48nIg) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/album/3365426), explaining what I do, what the problems are and how I overcome them. I think I'm the first to do that with a proect this size – at least I haven't found anyone else so far.

## Cost

I'm also documenting how much money I'm spending on the whole process. Since I didn't have any tools before, I had to buy everything. I've also rented a shed in Berlin, which costs me ~€280 per month.

All expenses are in [a spreadsheet on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ar92kaFryLaiSyvQbA11Mjp_Mdu69UG-MyL4m1TWva8/edit?usp=sharing).
