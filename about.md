Picassol is a sailing yacht that only uses renewable energies. It uses wind (and sometimes electricity) for propulsion and again electricity to drive everything else: instruments, cooking, the dinghy outboard, pumps, communication, lights. All electricity is generated using renewable resources such as sunlight and wind. We do not burn any fossil fuels like diesel, propane gas or gasoline.

We constantly experiment with our gear and with our way of living. We try out new gear, improve what works, get rid of what doesn’t. Living on renewable resources isn’t just about replacing your engine and its alternator with a big array of solar panels. It’s deciding what you really need and what you can do without. Shedding the ballast, focusing on what’s essential. Using fewer resource to achieve a better result.

With this boat we want to be an inspiration for others - boats as well as people living on land. We want to show that it’s not only possible but enjoyable to not rely on fossil resources. Using what’s available instead of buying whatever can be manufactured, going with the wind instead of against it — fewer options, less stuff, more freedom.

There’s a tiny catch: this boat doesn’t exist - yet. Right now we are preparing to build it ourselves, with the build scheduled to start in 2015 and the boat ready in 2017. Depending on how much money we’ll have and how much support (financial, equipment) we’ve been able to get the boat will start out somewhat ordinary and we’ll convert everything to renewable resources step by step, again depending on money and support.
