The following is a list of gear other people have recommended or that I have discovered and found worth remembering. Of course, all gear is only a means to an end so I don’t want to focus on it too much, but if I’m going to sail across oceans I want to rely on things that work.

The list is incomplete and contains links to products as well as ideas. I’m going to fill the gaps and add stuff over time.

### Boats

* [Pogo](http://www.pogostructures.com/) - lightweight, fast, minimal, unsinkable
* [Bente 24](http://bente24.com/) - innovative 24ft design from Germany
* [Seascape 27](http://www.thinkseascape.com/en/seascape-27/) - fast cruising
* [Didi 950](http://dixdesign.com/didi950.htm) - plywood dyi design
* [RM Yachts](http://www.rm-yachts.com/en/home) - fast cruisers made out of plywood

### Deck

Non-skid: [Kiwi Grip](http://senonskid.com/users/awp.php?ln=715388)

### Hull

Vinyl foil instead of repaint - cheaper, removable, easier to add custom design

### Rig

* Low friction rings, for example to [replace jib tracks](http://anasaziracing.blogspot.com/2013/09/antal-floating-jib-ring.html), for lazy jacks etc. (e.g. made by [Antal](http://www.antal.it/index.php/en/accessories/low-friction-ring)
* Titanium screws/backplates - they never rust
* [Ropeye](http://www.ropeye.com) loops instead of shackles and metal eyes
* 4th reef instead of storm sail - points higher, easier to set up
* [Jurgan Tool-Free Clevis Pin](http://www.crealock.com)
* [PROtect tapes LOOPX](http://www.protect-tapes.com/products/loopx)
* [Dynex Dux](http://www.sailmagazine.com/boatworks/dynex-dux-across-atlantic) standing rigging - lighter and stronger than wire

#### Sails

* [ATN gale sail](http://www.atninc.com/atn-gale-sail-sailing-equipment.shtml) - storm jib that you put over the furled genoa. An inner forestay would be preferable as it moves the sail closer to the mast.

### Anchoring

* [Mantus chain hook](http://mantusanchors.com/mantus-chain-hook/) - to attach snubber to anchor chain

### Propulsion

* [Torque Jet](http://www.torquejet.com/)
* [Torqueedo](http://www.torqeedo.com/) - electric outboards
* [Watt&Sea Propulsor](http://www.wattandsea.com/en/4kw-propulsor) - electric saildrive

### Dinghy

* [Torqueedo Travel](http://www.torqeedo.com/us/electric-outboards/travel-503-1003-with-integrated-battery-for-inflatables-dinghies-yachts-up-to-1-5-tons) electric outboard - no gasoline on board, yay
* [Lehr](http://golehr.com) propane outboard - not as green as electric but still better than gas

### Electronics

distributed power system instead of single panel (shorter cables, easier to reconfigure)

#### Instruments

* NKE
* B&G

#### Communications

* [DeLorme inReach SE](http://www.inreachdelorme.com/product-info/inreachse.php) - position tracker, can send messages via satellite, can send SOS

### Power Generation

* Solar panels: [Solbian](http://www.solbian.eu/) flexible panels
* [Watt&Sea Hydro generator](http://www.wattandsea.com/en/cruising-hydrogenerator) - up to 500W of power as long as the boat is moving
* wind generator

#### Batteries

* Lithium Ion batteries - 1/3 weight, charge faster, can be discharged more, high initial investment but total cost not that much higher due to longer life expectancy
* smart fridge controller: cools max when engine on, saves up to 30% power

### Steering

* [Hydrovane self-steering](http://www.hydrovane.com/) - doesn’t draw power, not really suited for fast boats though

### Shelter

* [ATN Dorcap](http://www.atninc.com/atn-dorcap-sailing-deck-gear.shtml) - soft dorade boxes for hatches

### Safety

* [Spinlock Deckvest](https://www.spinlock.co.uk/en/categories/lifejackets/product_groups/deckvest-5d-pro-sensor) - comfy, attachment point made from webbing instead of metal

### Emergency Gear

* [Jordan Series Drogue](http://www.jordanseriesdrogue.com/D_1.htm) - drogue that uses many small cones instead of a single big one, which makes it work much better
* [Forespar sta-plug](http://www.forespar.com/products/sta-plug.shtml) - plugs holes in the hull

### Interior

* cloths/foam boards instead of doors - lighter, can be removed, used for other things (Pogos have them, also Seascape)
* fabric bags/hangers for storage
* hammock
* bean bag

#### Heads

* water usage counter instead of tank gauge
* compost toilet

#### Galley

* only one bowl per person for everything - no washing up
* no electric water pressure - saves water
* water maker - able to use much smaller water tanks
* plastic barrels as dry/food storage

### Other

* [X-Hose](http://www.officialxhose.co.uk) - expandable hose
