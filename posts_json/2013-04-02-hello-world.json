At the moment it's only an idea, a dream. A dream to one day sail across the oceans, to sunbathe in a light breeze and endure the worst thunderstorm, to find paradise but to enjoy the journey to get there, to live an independent and simple life, with few possessions but rich in experiences.\n\n![Racing in a 420](http://media.tumblr.com/1e5edcbe3edca403513e911ff105fb2f/tumblr_inline_mkmcbzLy081qz4rgp.jpg)\n\n![First trip on a yacht](http://media.tumblr.com/21874ece45a24762a366695b1f6e7cb3/tumblr_inline_mkmccmvCPA1qz4rgp.jpg)\n\nThis project really started when I was 9 and swapped the piano for an [Optimist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimist_(dinghy)) in the local sailing club. Followed by years of racing on various dinghies such as a 420, in 2001 my friend Eric and I eventually stepped on a seaworthy sailing yacht - without a license or knowing what we were doing. After a chaotic but eye opening weekend at sea I started to acquire the countless licenses needed for renting yachts and started sailing on the Baltic and Mediterranean Sea. While studying in Sydney raced on Lasers and I invited a few people for a cruise at the Great Barrier Reef. Fast forward a few years and more trips in the Meds, in 2011 I find myself [crossing the Atlantic](http://alex.io/tagged/transatlantic) with three guys I don't even know. Back in the present I have another cruise planned for summer.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/52350438\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n\nNot long ago I stumbled across a trip report in Yachting World from the crew of [Anasazi Girl](http://anasaziracing.blogspot.com/) - an Open 40 race boat made of carbon that can sail 20 knots. I'm so fascinated I read through their entire blog, [watch the videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/anasaziracing?feature=watch) they have made and the [photos they have taken](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ssao/) on their 3-year voyage. Slowly an idea that has long been sleeping deep inside of me finally makes its way to the surface - to become like them, to become a voyager at sea.\n\nI start to research. I read more blogs, watch movies, look for books. I discover [The Voyager's Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Voyagers-Handbook-Essential-Cruising/dp/0071437657/ref=sr_1_1) a complete guide to going bluewater cruising and dive in.\n\nWith this blog I want to explore and document the steps going from landlubber to captain of the seas. The list of topics is endless, starting with obvious questions such as what kind of boat and crew I'll need and how I'm going to pay for it (sponsoring anyone?). For the geeks there's plenty of gear to explore, other people's blogs to read and link to and numerous movies to watch.\n\nFor now this is just an idea, a dream. The virus has infected me. It's only a question of time.\n\nOh, and there's two of us now.","can_reply":false}
