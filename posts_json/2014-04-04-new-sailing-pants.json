This comes at a price, but again thanks to the net I was able to get them â‚¬100 cheaper from [wetsuite outlet](https://www.wetsuitoutlet.co.uk/) in the UK. The salopettes have a slimmer cut than the trousers which means they are still too wide around the waist, but at least they don't look like you are wearing a sack of potatoes.\n\nThey cover the entire upper body including the shoulders, so I'm hoping I can get away without a jacket most of the time. I guess we'll see in two weeks. Can't wait!\n\nP.S. New GoPro camera arrived, too, so I'll be doing a bit of filming.","can_reply":false}
