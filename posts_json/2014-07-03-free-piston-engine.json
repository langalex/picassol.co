It's an engine without a crankshaft, i.e. the pistons are not connected to anything (thus free) but instead there is a coil around each cylinder generating electricity when the piston moves.\n\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/QUbBqSu9Hdc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe advantages of this setup are:\n\n* fewer moving parts, i.e. less chance of failure\n* less weight/more compact design\n* very efficient (42%)\n\nWhile their intended use case is hybrid/electric cars where the engine is only used to generate electricity for an electric motor, I could imagine this could be a nice replacement for a \"proper\" ship's diesel, too. I certainly wouldn't mind the weight saving and the ability to motor without the diesel beast running â€“ at least for short periods.","can_reply":false}
