You can either buy a new sail with the cells already laminated in or have your old sail upgraded. Or your bimini.\n\nI wouldn't expect these cells to become my main energy source but it would sure be a nice addition to the mix, especially since they don't really take up any space on deck. A 2sqm module is said to cost around â‚¬4000.\n\n(via [yacht.de](http://www.yacht.de/ausruestung/neue_ausruestung/grosssegel-als-stromgenerator/a87519.html))","can_reply":false}
