I've put my fingers on a class 950 fast cruiser, namely the Didi 950 - made from plywood and epoxy ([the first hull just got turned](http://dudleydix.blogspot.de/2014/09/didi-950-up-and-over.html)). The next question is: can I do it, and if yes, how long will it take and how much will it cost?\n\nTo answer the second question I've spent a good amount of time in the last weeks filling a spreadsheet with parts, supplier names and prices. At the moment this list contains 187 entries for a total of €26,800 - quite a few items don't have a price attached to them yet.\n\nSo far I have:\n\n* a kit for building a hull - supplied by Woodtec in Greece\n* most of the basic deck hardware - winches (€1,400 each!!), clutches, blocks, tracks\n* parts of an electrical system - shore connection, charger, batteries, alternator, switch panels, lights...\n* safety gear - life raft, epirb, MOB gear, fire extinguishers, pumps...\n* a dinghie\n* hatches\n\nWhat I don't have yet:\n\n* a rig\n* [an engine](http://picassol.co/post/95987045342/alternative-methods-of-yacht-propulsion)\n* epoxy for glueing the hull\n* a keel\n* boat building tools\n* auto pilot, navigation electronics\n* a place to build the hull - I've done a quick search and it seems to be really easy to  get a tiny (car parking) or a huge place (warehouse), but of course I haven't seen anything that comes close to what I need\n* anything inside the cabin, e.g. galley, heads\n* all the many parts I've forgotten\n\nSo, I guess I'll keep roaming the catalogs for a while to find out more prices. In addition I'll have to talk to a few builders to find out more about how long it takes. And I think I'll go to [Hanseboot](http://hanseboot.de/en/) in October to talk to some dealers and manufacturers.\n\nBut before all that: next week we're flying to France for our 1-week trip in the Biscay area on a Pogo 30.
