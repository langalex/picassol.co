We'll have it for one week in mid September, so not exactly next week. I can't wait!!\n\nThe boat is located on the Atlantic coast of Brittany in a place called Crouesty. This is right in the Bay of Biscay, so we'll be up for a bit of Atlantic swell and early fall storms, yay. After quite a few trips in warm sunny weather with lots of swimming and very little wind I very much look forward to some proper sailing and I expect some two digit numbers on the speed log while planing.\n\n![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/6b3e817a90827d5ef0ca77d62bc5e34c/tumblr_inline_mzaoogVBki1qcydz0.png)\n\nThe Pogo 30 comes either with an aluminium rig with a standard triangle main or carbon mast with a square top one - we'll have the latter. A bowsprit and genaker are also installed.\n\n![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/8e84f13346c06a956c40e32f6287b360/tumblr_inline_mzaol3wdq81qcydz0.jpg)\n\nIn total there are 6 berths (v-berth forward, 2 salon berths and one double aft - the other aft cabin is for storage). So far we're three people but are hoping to be 4-5 in the end. Even though the boat is only 30ft long its interior volume is considerable. With 3.7m it has an extremely beamy hull, and thanks to the hard chines the cabin floor should extend to almost that much. The interior is quite minimal with only a little bit of wood here and there. Mostly you look at the bare hull though. Everything is optimized for light weight and performance. One detail I especially like is that instead of doors the boat has pieces made out of a special canvas that snap into the bulkhead openings.\n\n![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/42c68a9b62fe374814643b0ddc59826b/tumblr_inline_mzaorggALw1qcydz0.png)\n\n\nThe boat's weight comes in at only 2.7 tons. Main and genoa are 60sqm together, the spinnaker is 92sqm. Sounds like some fun sailing. When you buy the boat you can order an optional swing keel which actually allows you to beach the boat, and it looks like we'll have that, too.\n\n\nIf you want to rent this baby, I found it on [boat buereau](http://www.boatbureau.com/boat/pogo-30/).","can_reply":false}
