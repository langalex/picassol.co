We'll be sailing her along the coast of Croatia with a crew of nine for one week in August.\n\n![](http://media.tumblr.com/7e1e3b81c6376037faf580c1567b4820/tumblr_inline_ml96d2gMmv1qcydz0.jpg)\n\nThis is probably the only coastal sailing I will be able to do this year. Apart from that I'll spend as much time as possible in small boats like Lasers on the lakes around Berlin.\n\nRenting a boat is a double-edged sword. The biggest advantage is that you can go sailing at all without buying your own boat. Not only would that be prohibitively expensive (anyone want to shell out a few hundred thousand €€ for a summer vacation?) it also wouldn't make any sense. You would have to find and pay for a place to leave the boat for the time you don't sail her and maintain and repair it all the time. In order to make this financially feasible a lot of people who do buy their own boats but don't live on them offer them for charter - loop closed.\n\nSecondly the size of your crew changes every time. While I have turned enough of my friends into sailors over the years,  there's always someone unable to come or somebody new. In 2009 we went with 8, the years after with 5 and 4, and this year it's going to be nine. Renting a boat means I can get just the right size for us – this year is going to be the biggest so far with 49 feet. It should have plenty of space for sailing during the day, below decks there are four double cabins plus one person has to sleep in the saloon. The boat has three heads (bathrooms) which should allow us to get ready in the morning pretty quickly. At ~3500€/week it actually ends up being a pretty affordable trip. Given we don't spend too many nights in marinas, which we are not planning to, the only other significant expenses will be for flights and food.\n\nThe downside of renting is that you rarely get the exact boat you want. The biggest brand in (especially charter) yachting is Bavaria. They were the first yard to produce ships in bulk which allowed them to significantly cut their costs and to this day Bavaria makes the cheapest boats. You can easily get a new mid range Bavaria for €150k where you would be paying €250 elsewhere for the same size. Then again you get what you pay for, so Bavarias are usually not the highest production quality and lack some of the details other boats might have. To me Bavarias are the most boring boats of them all. They are the equivalent of an Opel Astra (insert bread and butter car model for your country) or a Jack Wolfskin jacket. Everyone who doesn't care has one, and the ones who do are stuck with them most of the time, too.\n\nSo I'm actually quite happy we are going to be sailing a Sun Odyssey this year. I don't know much about the brand and have never sailed one, but at least it's a change. I've had so many Bavarias I've lost count (and who would want to count them anyway). Another reason I chose Inschallah over other boats was the fact that it had a fully battened main sail with Lazy Jacks.\n\n![](http://media.tumblr.com/1a5604eeff27cbfdfd04576c80573e86/tumblr_inline_ml96doRVHT1qcydz0.jpg)\n\nHere comes another rant: in recent year so called mast furling systems have become the norm - again mostly for charter boats and hence Bavarias. The idea is that instead of dropping the sail onto the boom, which can require a bit of work depending on your system, you roll it into the mast, which can be done by a single person turning a handle in the cockpit. Two huge problems:\n\n1. If the sail gets stuck while rolling it in or out you are going to have a lot of fun. A few years ago we lost an entire day of a week-long trip to just that. The guy from the charter company, whom we had called for help, spent most of the afternoon up in the mast, swearing and trying to get the sail out of the mast, armed with a wooden spoon from the galley (did I mention charter boats usually carry an excellent range of all the tools you are going to need - not).\n\n2. With a mast furling system the sail can't have any battens. Battens are poles inserted into the sail horizontally to give it a better shape - sails are actually wing-shaped, not flat. Without battens what you get is a piece of cloth that gets caught in the wind, but you don't get a proper sail.\n\n3. You have to be really careful when \"dropping\" or reefing, otherwise go to point one. A good, battened sail can be reefed even under pressure. It all ends up being much easier and safer than that complex new system that was supposed to make things easier in the first place. On a boat, simplicity is king. On long ocean going trips this is even more true, as every piece of equipment is going to break at some point. The mast furling system you don't have is not going to break.\n\nSpeaking of breaking: on every charter boat there is always something broken. That's probably true for every boat, but when you charter one you have one hour to find out and another two to get it repaired before you leave, otherwise you will have to live with it. Apart from the mast furler I've had broken wind instruments, punctured inflatable dinghies, non-functional windlasses, broken latches, leaks in the deck, blocked winches - you name it. It's never been critical so far, so you just deal with it. Let's hope it stays that way. Some time I should blog about the story where a charter boat lost its keel and only the crew after the next one realized it...\n\nThen there is gear. Sailing is not about gear, and it's not the gear that makes a trip great (guess what, it's the people), but when you have a Yachting World subscription and you read about Code 0 sails, curved dagger boards and hydro generators all the time there is a point at which you want to try out at least some of those. With a standard charter that's almost impossible - I've been trying to get a boat with at least a Spinnaker for years now and even though Inschallah has one it's broken at the moment and it's unclear whether the owner will replace it.\n\nAnyway, with all that being said I'm very grateful these charter boats exist, otherwise I probably would never have been able to get on a yacht. It's a jungle out there and you never know what you will get, but at least it's there. I can't wait for August and Inschallah!\n\nP.S. if you own a Bavaria or work for them, sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. They make great boats for what they charge. It's a personal thing. :)\n\nP.P.S. The names of charter boats can be problematic, too. If you think Inschallah sounds funny, try to imagine when we were sailing on [Biene Maja](http://youtu.be/lyXkXKBQ_9o) and people made fun of us and sang the song every time we came into a bay.\n","can_reply":false}
