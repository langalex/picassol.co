It's only a short trip but I hope we'll have plenty of wind to try out this beautiful racer. We'll start in Bremerhaven (located at the North Sea), go around Helgoland and then back. Great preparation for [our Pogo 30 trip in September](http://picassol.co/post/73095521753/pogo-30-here-we-come) I guess :D\n\n![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/f393408fe17b2f1190a37ae452898441/tumblr_inline_n0duilf9cR1qcydz0.jpg)\n\nThe Pogo 40 was introduced in 2005 with a cruising and a racing version (from what I can see we actually have the race version).
