Shot in the early sixties it features Eric and Susan Hiscock on their circumnavigation on the famous Wanderer III.\n\nOf course it's great to see the sailing and the places they visit. What's funny though is how much the world has changed. This starts with the boat: the log is some weird mechanical, rotating device, the sails \"are much better than the cotton ones we had before\". Everything is of course manual. Offshore navigation is performed with the sextant. Gender roles are clearly separated: \"Susan has dealt with kerosene stoves since her teens so there's no problem\" and \"has one of her washing days\". \n\nVery very nice to watch. It's available on Vimeo as a rental for $3.\n\nFound via [@projectatticus](https://twitter.com/atticusproject/status/500995001959329792).","permalink_url":"https://vimeo.com/77252749","html5_capable":true,"thumbnail_url":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/452384500_295x166.jpg","thumbnail_width":295,"thumbnail_height":166,"player":[{"width":250,"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/77252749?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"250\" height=\"140\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Beyond the West Horizon: Trailer\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"width":400,"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/77252749?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Beyond the West Horizon: Trailer\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"width":500,"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/77252749?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Beyond the West Horizon: Trailer\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>"}],"video_type":"vimeo","can_reply":false}
