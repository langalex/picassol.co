We yesterday went to see the [Ocean Film Tour](https://www.oceanfilmtour.com/), a small film festival dedicated to the ocean. Among other films about (kite) surfing, diving and the endangered Ross Sea they also showed a shortened version of [Maidentrip](http://www.maidentrip.com), the documentary about Laura Dekker's circumnavigation at the age of 14.

I have read quite a few negative reviews about it recently calling it a boring vacation documentary and other things. I just wanted to say: don't trust the reviews. I loved every second of what I saw. How she struggled in the beginning, being becalmed for days but with a huge swell, her boat falling apart (not all of it), how she makes friends along the way, but also enjoying being alone on the water, not to mention the beautiful places she visits.

Maybe I'm biased towards movies with sailing boats in them (after all [I like Waterworld](http://picassol.co/post/50006856509/waterworld), but maybe there are just films where you have to be a sailor to appreciate them, and [others where you can't be one to enjoy any of it](http://sailing.about.com/od/resourcesforsailors/fl/Sailors-Review-of-Movie-All-Is-Lost.htm).
