title: Croatia Sailing Trip
---
I just came back from a one-week sailing trip in Croatia. Having invited 8 1/2 friends (the 1/2 being 17 months old) we spent six leisurely days sailing the Kornati Archipelago in mostly light winds. My two personal projects were to get a bit more involved in boat maintenance and hoisting the spinnaker.

### The Boat

After some trouble and a general dislike of in-mast furling systems I went to some lengths to secure a boat with a "conventional" drop-on-the-boom system and lazy jacks. After some looking around we even got a fully battened main, and with that a 49 foot Jeanneau Sun Oddyssey named [Inschallah](http://www.pitter-yachting.com/at/yacht/Sun-Odyssey-49-Inschallah/101235/). The features that stood out for me were the gigantic chart table (> 2m wide!) with its ergonomic lie-down chair and dual chart plotters (but none in the cockpit) and the huge sail locker at the bow - finally a place to put all those fenders (and the spinnaker). The cockpit was big as could be expected from a boat this size. It didn't have a fold-down transom like all the new Bavarias though - I have to admit those looked pretty sexy and I might have to try one of those next time. Another extra was the electric winch which allows those who want to skip the workout when hoisting the main.

These winches draw quite a bit of energy, leading us to our biggest problem: the electrical system and its lack of power. The boat had a 300 Ah battery bank with no means to charge it other than the engine. We did not use electricity excessively - a few of the (non-LED) lights in the evening, auto pilot (not much, see below), water pump, windlass, instruments, wifi (!) and fridge - but had to keep the engine running a good 2-3h each day while sailing. Did I mention I hate running the engine? I started turning off the fridge and a few other things when the engine wasn't running but it really didn't get that much better. Please at least add some solar panels next time. The resulting low voltage (mostly in the lower 11.x range) resulted in problems with the auto pilot which spat out all sorts of error messages and refused to work unless the engine was running. A bit frustrating, but very much manageable with a crew of 9.

## Repairs

As usual a few things were already broken or broke during the trip. First was one of the toilet pumps. Highly motivated to practice my maintenance skills I rummaged through the mess of toolboxes on board and opened the pump. It turned out one of the gasket rings had slipped out of position, probably because of some over-enthusiastic pumping - an easy fix. Next was the anchor light which was not working at all. I took the opportunity to climb the mast (that electric winch did come in handy) but at the top everything looked good. I next opened a lid near the mast step in order to trace the cable in question, but quickly shut it again, pushing the mess of entangled wires that had fallen out of the opening back in its place. So, no anchor light, we left on the deck floodlights (again no LEDs) instead. During the trip we lost whatever had held down the first reef at the mast, but were unable to trace back what it was, so it was reef 2 and 3. Near the end we got a 10cm tear in the main, just below the second reef. Not yet knowing anything about sail repair we left that and kept the second reef in place.

One evening we were unpleasantly surprised by the genoa furler refusing to furl in the last third of the sail. Conveniently the wind had picked up quite a bit so leaving the sail flapping while finding a solution hwasn't an option. We ended up sailing up and down the bay we were going to anchor in. After a few fruitless attempts of first using more power (no, not the winches) and dropping the sail (didn't move) I stuck a large screwdriver between forestay and sail and rolled in the sail by turning the hole thing by hand. To my relief this also fixed the problem of the jammed furler (the furling line had wrapped around itself).

## Sailing

As expected we had mostly light winds, only on the fourth day did it go up to 5 bft. That meant easy and relaxed sailing. We lost a fender once (who the hell had forgotten to put that into the locker) which gave us a perfect reason to rescue it properly - under sails. The first time we want past it too fast, on the second run we got it, with a little bit of braking help from the engine.

My personal highlight was hoisting the spinnaker on the last day of sailing. After days of close reaching we were finally on a broad reaching course with 1-2 bft of wind - perfect conditions as I had never hoisted one on a big boat (but have plenty of racing experience with one on dinghies). It took us 20 minutes to figure out the boom, sheets etc. but after that a beautiful red/yellow striped balloon sail pulled us through the water without any fuss (on my Atlantic crossing 2 years ago without one we had so many problems going downwind with two headsails - this would have been so much easier).

## The area

We started on an island called Murter which is located near the city of Zadar in northern Dalmatia, went a few miles south and then headed into the national park that spans the Kornati islands. We spent all the nights at anchor in various bays avoiding the busy and expensive marinas as well as the buoy fields whose reliability is oftentimes questionable, especially for a boat our size (so we heard). We really liked Lopatica on Kornat (lots of space, well protected, climb up the hill for a spectacular sunset, bring shoes) and that one bay at the south of Katina (right after you pass between Kornati and Katina from west to east it's on your port side). The rangers will charge 60 Kuna per person for staying there but they are worth it.

## Conclusions

Apart from the usual problems with boat (see above) and people (a few seasick, a baby crying at 6:30am) we really had perfect conditions. The area around Kornati is great for sailing. We had wind and sunshine most of the time. The crew was wonderful, I can't wait for next time. And I made a video - to be released soon.
