Until this point this blog has been very theoretical. I've talked about boats, other people and race events, but not much about us yet. Time to change that. Time to make some plans.

So here it is: within the next four years, i,e. until mid 2017 we want to save/collect €100,000. We'll then use €70-80,000 to buy a boat and the rest to fit it out over the following year (2017/2018). Money made during that time goes into savings for the trip, which will be used for things like repairs and emergencies. Mid 2018 we should be ready to go.

We are expecting to buy a 5-10 (probably closer to 10) year-old GRP cruiser. Even though €100k is a shitload of money for us it's not that much for a boat, so it'll be rather basic without anything fancy (should we win the lottery in the meantime we'll upgrade to a [POGO 12.50](http://www.finot-conq.com/en/content/pogo-1250)).

I've rented out my apartment and all the money from that now goes to a dedicated savings account. In addition all my previous savings will go into the boat. I've stopped buying crap like vacuum cleaning robots and all the money saved from that will go on that savings account as well. Tax returns, salary increases, any additional income goes straight to the boat.

In addition we'll try to find some sponsors that can either give us parts (sails, dinghy, electronics etc.) or help pay for them. We haven't figured that part out yet but expect a blog post on that soon.

After we set sail we'll do a one year trip, probably around the Atlantic, to get our feet wet and see how we like it. We'll probably have to continue to work part time to pay for ongoing expenses. Being a programmer that should be doable.

If we like our new cruising life we'll continue on for who knows how long, first on to the Pacific, possibly do a circumnavigation. Write a book, make a film, we'll see.  If not, we sell the boat again and find a way to spend all that money on something worthy. What could possibly go wrong? :)
