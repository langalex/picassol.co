I recently read "[Race France To France: Leave Antarctica To Starboard](http://www.racefrancetofrance.com/)", a book by Rich Wilson about his taking part in the 2008/09 Vendée Globe. The Vendée Globe is a solo, non stop round the world race that takes place every 4 years and is considered one of the toughest races, if not the toughest in the world. The sailors start in Les Sables D'Olonne in France and take their 60 foot IMOCAs - which are the boating equivalent of crazily overpowered Formula 1/rally cars - down around the cape of good hope and then eastwards towards Australia. The entire trip around now lasts a bit under 80 days for the fastest boats.

Rich wasn't in it for the trophy though, his mission was bigger. He had been running an [education program](http://www.sitesalive.com/) for high school students that taught the curriculum by connecting it to real world situations and problems. After having created learning materials from all kinds of places and out of all kinds of situations he was now going to teach students through the eyes of a round-the-world solo sailor. For that he would write aritcles and record audio and video clips an addition to doing the race. Oh, and with 58 he was the oldest in the fleet, and he has asthma.

The first challenge to take part is to get a competitive boat. A new one will cost about ~€2m, but I think you can get an old one for €800k - which is what Rich did: after a long and difficult search for sponsors he was able to get one from the 2000 edition of the race.

> Michel had told me that his new 2008 generation boat Foncia had 30% more righting moment, equating to stability, in turn equating to horsepower, than his 2000 generation winning boat PRB

Well, he was going to be 30% slower than the new boats, meaning he would have to work 30% more to get there. Off to a good start.

Next up was to get himself and the boat into shape. He hired a personal trainer who got him into better shape than he had been in his twenties, even if it meant throwing up after training. As for the boat he received a lot of help from his competitors, especially from Michel Desjoyeux. In one chapter of the book Rich describes how he had been sending emails to Michel asking him all kinds of questions about the race - in his broken French. Michel answered all these questions - in just as broken English.

As the race starts the real work begins. All the systems on the boat are manual so every maneuver is a lot of work and takes a long time. To complete a single tack takes 30 minutes, most of that is spent grinding at the pedestal to cant the keel from leeward to the new windward side. In addition he has to change and reef sails as conditions change all the time - and these sails are giant and weigh hundreds of kilograms. On a boat as big as an IMOCA that means on an average day Rich puts around 5000 revelations on the grinder, requiring him to eat 6000 kcal to make up for it.

The crazy speeds these boats achive - 20-30kn is doable - in combination with the waves created by storms means he gets thrown around the boat a lot. Not only does this make working and sleeping a lot more complicated, it also results in two broken ribs a few days in. Later in the race the same ribs break again. There is nothing he can do but endure the pain and keep on grinding. At one point he decides to wear the helmet that he brougt for climbing the mast at sea all the time - I bet bringing some body armor, like the America's Cup guys now have, would have been useful, too.

> And one began to think other sports comically easy in physical endurance and mental persistence. Could Michael Schumacher stop his Ferrari and repair it by himself on turn 3?

> Even the Boston Marathon, that I had run four times, and had once considered the pinnacle of endurance, now seemed a simple afternoon jog.

Also, sleep deprivation and its effects:

> Somehow a notion took hold, from a dream or daydream, that I had to download a twenty-ton anchor through the satphone onto the boat. I didn’t know why, I just knew that I had to.

Rich is not the only one to suffer, his boat does, too. And those of his competitors. Of the average Vendée Globe fleet less than half makes it to the finish line. The rest lose their keel or mast, break their hull in a collision or have something else broken that they cannot repair themselves (the sailors can sail for land in order to make repairs but are not allowed to accept help from anyone or go ashore). As for Rich he at one time has keel problems, but they disappear after a while. The other major problem is that his auto pilot (and its backup) like to fail every now and then, either partly (they still steer the boat but not at an angle to the wind but only at a compass angle) or completely, which means Rich has to steer the boat himself and at the same time figure out what's wrong and fix it. To do that, at one point he successfully heaves-to, something probably nobody has tried before on an IMOCA.

In addition to his own stories the book tells those of other sailors before Rich. People who glued their delaminated main sail back together during a storm; others who had broken their mast, got the remains back on board, set up a jury rig in a bay a few hundred miles away and still completed the race while eating seaweed because they had run out of proper food.

All in all a fascinating and also somewhat terrifying read. It surely sounds like the Vendée Globe has earned its title as the toughest race. Let's see if I can make it, until I am 58 :)
