With a growing number of electronic and electric devices on board the question of power supply becomes more and more important. There are numerours ways to generate electricity, each of course with their own advantages and problems. Let's see.

### Power consumption

... falls in to three basic categories:

#### Navigation/instruments

Yes we all carry our paper charts and compass for "manual" navigation, but I have yet to encounter a yacht without electronic instruments. At the very least you have GPS, depth sounder, log (speed) and a VHF radio. Next up comes an auto pilot, electronic chart plotter, radar, AIS and satellite communications. These devices don't necessarily draw tons of power (ok radar does) but on the average boat you will find quite a few of them and most of them run for long hours.

#### Electric helpers

Most boats in the upper 30 foot range will at least have an electric windlass for lifting the anchor. The part of the auto pilot that actually turns your rudder falls into this category, too. Bigger boats can have electric winches, electrically folding tables, transoms and what not. These devices draw quite a bit of power but run only for short periods of time, the auto pilot being a bit of an exception.

#### Luxury (more or less)

Fridge, freezer, water maker, washing machine, dish washer, diving compressor, lights, music, you name it. Some of these can be quite a burden to your electricity bill, drawing lots of power for extended periods of time.

To summarize: most boats have a certain amount of power drawn over long periods of time, accompanied by shorter bursts of high power consumption. In addition some devices run more at night (lights) while others are needed during day time.

### Power Generation

First of all every boat has batteries. Almost all devices draw power from the batteries, and these are in turn charged regularly. You should have at least two battery banks - one to crank the engine, one for all the rest. Nobody wants to risk not being able to start the engine because of the fridge running for too long. Apart from playing a somewhat important role in a boat's safety, almost all boats can use their engine to generate electricity by having it drive an alternator.

#### Engine/Alternator

So the alternator is the most basic and widely spread means of charging your batteries. Its advantage is that it generate significant amounts of power independently from the weather, meaning it needs no sunshine, no wind or anything else, just fuel. Which is also its biggest downturn. A lot of sailors will agree with me that running an engine while sailing - just for the sake of generating power - feels wrong. It stinks, it's loud, it burns fossil fuels, it's against everything sailing stands for. So, let's quickly get to the alternatives.

#### Generator

A generator is like an engine but optimized for generating electricity, hence it isn't really any better. Larger boats oftentimes draw so much power with all their devices that running a generator is their only option. Bah.

#### Shore Power

If you spend most of your evenings ashore a cable running from land to a socket in your boat can be a very convenient way of providing power. It greatly reduces your mobility though, so I wouldn't count on it.

#### Solar Panels

Solar panels turn sunlight into electricity. They have no moving parts, hence nothing can makes any noise or wear out. Their biggest problem is that they don't work that well at night or when it's cloudy. In addition they are really not very efficient at what they're doing (expect 60-80W out of a medium-sized panels under a blue sky). That means you need lots of panels to generate enough juice and to compensate for long off-times. Still, lots of boats have them as part of their power generation strategy.

Panels can either be solid and mounted on an arch near the stern or flexible and fitted on the deck. The former is better because there's less chance of parts of the rig castig a shadow onto the panel (a tiny shadow cast by a wire can decrease power generation by > 80%), the latter is less bulky and looks better.

#### Wind Generator

Wind generators, yes, convert wind into electrical current. They can generate a bit more power than solar panels (compared to their size) but they're not exactly power plants either. They do have moving parts that make noise and break. Some smart people have invented [bladeless](http://www.gizmag.com/saphonian-bladeless-wind-turbine/24890/) [wind generators](http://www.impactlab.net/2013/04/07/bladeless-wind-turbine-has-no-moving-parts/) with no moving parts but I haven't seen any made for use on boats yet.

In addition there is one problem specific to boats, and that's apparent wind. When you go upwind the true wind and the airstream generated from moving forward add up and result in a stronger apparent wind, meaning the wind generator can produce more power. But when you go downwind you have to subtract the airstream from the true wind, leaving you with less apparent wind, hence less power. And now think about how much of your time you sail upwind vs. downwind...

#### Hamster Wheels

Nah, just kidding. Not enough power, too much squeaking.

#### Hydro Generator

These are pretty new and afaik have been introduced by the Vendee Globe guys. Instead of holding a turbine into the (apparent) wind you flip it upside down and hold it into the water. This has two huge advantages: water being much thicker than air you can generate lots more energy from it (I've heard ~500W) plus it works downwind just as well as upwind. What matters is your speed through water. Which brings us to the downside: it's not gonna do anything while at anchor. Also, seaweed and other things floating in the water can clog or destroy it, see [Alex Thompson in the 2013 Vendee Globe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSo8R03z08).

### Conclusions

As you can see all these methods of power generation have their own advantages and disadvantages. To get a reliable power system you have to combine a few of them. How much and how many depends on your consumption. Before plastering the entire deck with panels it might be worth considering if that electrically controlled bimini or the 200l freezer is really necessary. It probably isn't.

For myself if I can afford it I'll try to go with a hydro generator for when the boat is moving plus deck mounted solar panels for when at anchor in combination with as few luxury gadgets as possible.
