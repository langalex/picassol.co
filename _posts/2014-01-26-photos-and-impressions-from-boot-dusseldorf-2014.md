title: Photos and impressions from Boot Düsseldorf 2014
---
We spent the last weekend in Düsseldorf at the [Boot](http://www.boat-duesseldorf.com/) boat show, taking a look at new boats and gear, but also uncovering a few interesting green boating projects. Here comes:

First was the [Pogo Structures](http://www.pogostructures.com/) booth. Unfortunately they didn't bring any boats but only these small models. Nevertheless, after telling them we might want to buy one they immediately invited us to visit the yard and go on a test sail. Of course we said yes.

I had to take off my stilettos before being allowed on any boat.

Uhm, "modern" lighting on this 27ft Polish boat. Fortunately you can turn them to white and red, too.

Fold-away tap - smart.

Ah. back in the days.

Line bags - every boat should have those.

More bags.

Smart and simple door locking mechanism - I like.

Glue-on solar panels - I'll write some more about these in a future post.

A trimaran that folds down to 3.6m beam when marina space in expensive.

The new [Varianta 37](http://www.varianta.info/home/37/level02/varianta-37.html) (base price 89k€) was well-visited...

![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/42d3e8a385e392e924894152557620ff/tumblr_inline_n00mdsn6kd1qcydz0.jpg)

... and good-looking on the inside.

Buy this Hanse 55 and get a turbojet tender for free. Conveniently fits into the cockpit locker.

View from the canteen. The Schnitzel for 20€ was disastrous.

![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/08466bcbbac3f971e5243e7d33dfb33d/tumblr_inline_n00mht2fDd1qcydz0.jpg)

The new [Seascape 27](http://www.gigodesign.com/seascape/) - I had been looking forward to see that one...

![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/4ad0bc7e228fb8d04bb84d64be536202/tumblr_inline_n00mj6bSDt1qcydz0.jpg)

... engine sits in the cockpit and can be stowed when not in use.

Lightweight doors made from foam and fabric, snap into position magnetically. Nice.

Seascape make these stowage bags themselves...

The "galley". End of Seascape visit.

A 130 horsepower outboard on a sailboat. Why not, right?

Helm station of a Moody 54. You can't see the bow (actually you can't see anything at all because your view is blocked by the deck saloon) but at least you can stare at all these Raymarine instruments.

![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/c4f73943048bab15ec5c65b4a6c344b0/tumblr_inline_n00msgri891qcydz0.jpg)

1200Ah should be enough for anybody (still on the Moody).

![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/cf0f8a9a20d5762aecd749af3e7471a7/tumblr_inline_n00mtisi5I1qcydz0.jpg)

An [inflatable catamaran](http://www.tiwal.com/) that weighs 50kg and fits in 2 bags. Want.

This one is not inflatable but it can fly thanks to the foils below.

[Premier 45](http://www.pct.ae/composites_projects.php?project=11) - carbon hull, carbon rig, even the stairs to enter the boat are made from carbon. Why? Because the company that made this boat usually makes buildings out of carbon, so why not? The upside is, this boat is only €0.5m, because when you buy enough carbon for buildings the price goes down - a lot.

![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/dcfeae67cab4bd6aee1cade595bbfc87/tumblr_inline_n00n1itahh1qcydz0.jpg)

LED lights below the floor boards - you can change the color.

Nav station with iMac. Doubles as a movie theatre.

Beneteau with funky new colors on the outside...

... and your grandma's reading light in the cockpit.

This wheel may impress your landlubber friends, but the only way to get past it is to climb.

84ft Oyster with windows. How did they even get it in there? Also, you needed an appointment to get on it.

A Kayak with two sails and an electric motor charged via solar panels. Questions?

The block is dead. Long live the [low friction ring](http://anasaziracing.blogspot.de/2013/09/antal-floating-jib-ring.html).

The [e-tech](http://etechdrives.com) guys had a complete electric propulsion system including hydrogen cell, lithium batteries and electric engine (doubled as a generator when sailing). The only problem was price (at least €20k for a sailboat).

![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/3c0fa8b76b49879e2efc73d9ea5aab05/tumblr_inline_n00nz7li9v1qcydz0.jpg)

We talked to [Torqueedo](http://www.torqeedo.com/) about putting an electric engine on a 30ft sailboat. They [sell a ~10hp engine](http://www.torqeedo.com/us/electric-outboards/cruise-t-tiller-controlled-dinghies-motor-boats-sailboats-up-to-4-tons) for around €2k plus [batteries](http://www.torqeedo.com/us/electric-outboards/power-26-104-intelligent-lithium-battery) for ~€2.5k - each gives you between 3 and 12nm range. Somebody needs to invent better batteries.

This little guy runs on electricity, too, and it gets you a few meters under water.

The new [watt&sea hydro generators](http://www.wattandsea.com/en) deliver up to 600W. Enough to charge up the batteries to power a 6KW engine? Hm....

![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/e6c69e070dc84afd9df0c9f9cab4a147/tumblr_inline_n00o7ucu761qcydz0.jpg)

Had a nice chat with [NKE](http://www.nke-marine-electronics.com/home/). I guess I'll have to buy their instruments one day.

Big boat needs big bonsai.
