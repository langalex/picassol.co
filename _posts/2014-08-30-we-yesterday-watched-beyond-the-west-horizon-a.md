caption: "We yesterday watched \"Beyond the West Horizon\", a real gem of a sailing
  film. Shot in the early sixties it features Eric and Susan Hiscock on their circumnavigation
  on the famous Wanderer III.\n\nOf course it's great to see the sailing and the places
  they visit. What's funny though is how much the world has changed. This starts with
  the boat: the log is some weird mechanical, rotating device, the sails \"are much
  better than the cotton ones we had before\". Everything is of course manual. Offshore
  navigation is performed with the sextant. Gender roles are clearly separated: \"Susan
  has dealt with kerosene stoves since her teens so there's no problem\" and \"has
  one of her washing days\". \n\nVery very nice to watch. It's available on Vimeo
  as a rental for $3.\n\nFound via [@projectatticus](https://twitter.com/atticusproject/status/500995001959329792)."
