Toyota has come up with what it calls a [free piston engine](http://www.roadandtrack.com/go/out-of-turn-toyota-engine). It's an engine without a crankshaft, i.e. the pistons are not connected to anything (thus free) but instead there is a coil around each cylinder generating electricity when the piston moves.

The advantages of this setup are:

* fewer moving parts, i.e. less chance of failure
* less weight/more compact design
* very efficient (42%)

While their intended use case is hybrid/electric cars where the engine is only used to generate electricity for an electric motor, I could imagine this could be a nice replacement for a "proper" ship's diesel, too. I certainly wouldn't mind the weight saving and the ability to motor without the diesel beast running – at least for short periods.
