title: Mini Boat Yard Episode 3 - lots of sanding, sawing foam is a lot more fun.
---

After applying another epoxy coat, I hand to sand the boat all over again – most of it by hand, as the power tools are to big to reach into the tiny spaces of a tiny boat. Argh!

Next was fitting the foam floatation. There's a block of foam under each seat, which makes the boat unsinkable, even when it's full of water. The foam is embedded in epoxy again to make it more robust and also waterproof. Since foam is a lot softer than epoxy, that went quite a bit easier and faster.
