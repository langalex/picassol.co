When it came out in 1995 the reviews were not very positive and on IMDB it only got a 5.9 rating. The film Waterworld ist set in a time when the pole caps have melted and everything is covered by water. People either live nomadic lives on their boats or in small floating communities. Resources are scarce, so attacks and raids are the norm. Our hero lives on his own sailing trimaran and at the beginning of the story stumbles into an adventure involving fighting the evil guys, rescuing a little girl and lots of sailing. It might not be the most innovative plot, but what the critics who gave these low ratings were clearly missing is a passion for boats. The boat in Waterworld is one of the most fascinating I have ever seen in a film and this is what this post is about.

## The hull

As you can see the boat is a trimaran, meaning it has three hulls - one center and two to the side. It's not a very common configuration as having three hulls is not very practical for living aboard, but trimarans surely are fast boats. It's not clear what material the boat is made of - it looks like aluminum, which would make sense, but in once scene the main character - only referred to as the mariner on IMDB, no name -  looks for resin to fix one of the hulls - this would only make sense for a composite material like glass or carbon fiber. Aluminum would have to be welded instead.
Length wise I my guess is it's a 60ft boat.

## The Rig

The boat is a sloop, i.e. one main sail, one head sail. The sails seem to be made out of cloth and are heavily patched. Given the circumstances and understandable solution. The first surprise is an automatic, spring or weight loaded, sail hoisting system. When the mariner  pulls on a lever the telescopic boom extends, the main sail goes up and the head sail unfurls - all within a few seconds and fully automated. This boat is surely optimized for single handed sailing. The same mechanism can also reef/furl the sails.

In addition to using some preloaded weight the system can also be powered by a vertical wind turbine attached to the mast. This turbine is connected to all kinds of systems on the boat. In addition to sail handling it can drive the propeller, charge the batteries and power some sort of mast elevator that allows the mariner to get pulled up the mast within a few seconds. A truly innovative solution that I'm sure generates much more power than the small wind generators or solar panels of most boats today.

## Cockpit

The central cockpit element is a steering/grinder combination. The boat is steered by rotating the entire system, The grinder can be hooked up to various parts of the boat, i.e. handling sheets and halyards. It is not clear how the self steering works. We do see the boat sailing without anyone steering but there seems to be no wind vane and there's definitely no electronic auto pilot. At this point I can only assume the rudder gets fixed in a position and the boat is so well balanced it just follows a course.

## Eating/drinking

The boat has some sort of water maker that turns urine back into freshwater, but we don't see if it works with salt water as well. For food there is a single tomato plant on board - unfortunately it gets lost during the film.

In addition there is a fixed harpoon at the bow and a small, hand-held one to take into the water. In order to catch fish - or rather a sea monster - the mariner jumps from the stern of the boat (attached to a line) and acts as bait for the monster. When the monster comes up he kills it with the hand-held harpoon and winches it on board - a practical solution that seems to work quite well. A bit more work than just pulling a small fishing line but the results speak for themselves. For cooking the monster there is a BBQ on board. 

## Entertainment

The boat has an automated music system consisting of a harmonica that is driven by the wind - again very practical on a sailing boat.

A bit of a larger extra is the diving dome. The mariner can use this to take guests diving without them having to wear diving equipment. They just dive under the dome and breathe the trapped air. He himself is equipped with gills behind the ears so doesn't need the dome.

## Conclusion

All in all a fascinating boat with a few extras I would love to see on my own boat one day. If you are in any way interested in boats and I can highly recommend watching Waterworld.
