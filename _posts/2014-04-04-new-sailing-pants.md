In preparation for our Pogo 40 trip in two weeks I bought a pair of Musto MPX Salopettes.

According to The Internet Musto stuff is the most durable and overall bestest stuff you can get. This comes at a price, but again thanks to the net I was able to get them €100 cheaper from [wetsuite outlet](https://www.wetsuitoutlet.co.uk/) in the UK. The salopettes have a slimmer cut than the trousers which means they are still too wide around the waist, but at least they don't look like you are wearing a sack of potatoes.

They cover the entire upper body including the shoulders, so I'm hoping I can get away without a jacket most of the time. I guess we'll see in two weeks. Can't wait!

P.S. New GoPro camera arrived, too, so I'll be doing a bit of filming.
