title: Mini Boat Yard Episode 9 - completing the hull
---

Finished the hull! I started by glueing the pre-cut 6mm plywood panels from the kit to the stringers. There were panels for the sides and the bottom. For the round section in-between, I had to cut my own panels. Because of the tight curve, these are only 3mm thick, and I had to apply two layers.

Next up, turning the hull and then working on the inside.
