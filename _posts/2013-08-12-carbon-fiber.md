title: Carbon Fiber
---
Continuing my interest in [building things](http://bluewaterproject.org/post/55245326201/3d-printing), this week we are going to look into a class of materials I find particularly interesting: carbon fiber composites.

The reasons are manifold: for one it's being used to build race boats and parts - these are high performance materials and performance is something I like very much. Building things out of carbon composites yields very stiff structures which allows the parts to be very light weight. In addition it doesn't actually seem to be too hard to build simple things yourself.

To make carbon fiber parts is basically simple. You make a mold, put a few layers of fibers on it and then drown everything in a special resin. Let it dry for a day and done. :)

The devil is of course in the details. How many layers of fibers do you need and in what direction do you lay them out? How much resin do you add and how do you make sure there's no air trapped in bubbles? The less air and the more precise control you have over the amount of resin the stiffer your end product is going to be.

There are three main ways to build carbon parts: wet lay up, vacuum infusion and prepreg, each coming with its on (dis)advantages.

Wet lay up is the cheapest as you dont need any special equipment but you have very little control about your resin. Basically you put your fiber mats in the mold and then apply the resin with a brush or something similar. Let it dry, done.

With vacuum infusion you start with putting your fibers in the mold. Then you put everything in a vacuum bag, attach a vacuum pump and suck the air out. After that you let the vacuum pull in the resin through one or many hoses. This leads to a much more even distribution of the resin, hence higher quality. The whole vacuum makes the process more expensive though. Many race boat hulls are built this way, for example the upcoming [Volvo Ocean 65 one design](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/theboat.html) class.

The third method, prepreg, stands for pre-impregnated and means you buy fiber mats that have already been, well, impregnated, with the right amount of resin. This yields the highest quality, but boy are these prepreg mats expensive. High load parts like masts are often made from prepreg fibers - you really don't want any problems in your mast and the amount of material you need is not that much.

Now what's the easiest way to get started? Companies like [easy composites](http://www.easycomposites.co.uk/) sell a [mold making kit](http://www.easycomposites.co.uk/products/starter-kits/epoxy-mould-making-starter-kit.aspx) for £30. To start with wet lay up you need the [laminating starter kit](http://www.easycomposites.co.uk/Products/carbon-fibre-laminating-starter-kit.aspx) for £34. If you want to try vacuum infusion they've got you covered, too with their [resin infusion starter kit](http://www.easycomposites.co.uk/resin-infusion-starter-kit.aspx) for £302, which includes vacuum bags and a pump.

Maybe I'll start with a carbon fiber bucket - just to be safe - and then work my way up from there.
