title: Did Mini MK3 kit - which part goes where
---

The kit for my Mini 650 came without any instructions. It took me a whole day to figure out which part goes where. I made a list. Maybe it'll help somebody else one day.

Not included in the kit:

* stringers
* hardwood cap for the bow
* the plywood covering the tangents
* plywood to cover the hull area between the tangents
* plywood for the inside - berths, water tanks
