I just bought a pair of [Vivo Barefoot Ultras](http://www.vivobarefoot.com/eu/mens/ultra-mens), actually for sports, but I think these would make for some great boat shoes as well. They go in the direction of [clogs](http://www.crocs.com/classic-crocs-shoes/classic-styles,default,sc.html?intid=mm_shop_by_classics_140201) but maybe a bit less weird.

The shoe consists of an outer plastic grid and an inner sock that can be removed. Without the sock you essentially get a sandal that protects your feet plus will dry quickly after contact with water.

If it's still warm enough I'll try them out on our upcoming trip in September in France.
