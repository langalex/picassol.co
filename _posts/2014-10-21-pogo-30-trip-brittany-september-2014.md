In September we went to France for a week, sailing on the Pogo 30 "Avel Biz" (does anyone know what that means?), a 30ft cruiser-racer with an emphasis on racing. Sailing was great fun - every day was sunny and around 15 knots of wind. The boat sails great and we got to play around with the asymmetric a lot. Here's the video I made:

### Day 1

* took over the boat: we love that the hull is red - best-looking boat in the marina
* the swing keel is awesome, it reduces draft to 1m which lets us go anywhere
* the open cockpit lets us inflate and launch the dinghy from there
* the Pogo 30 looks perfect for cruising with 2 people
* the boat has a trinquette on an inner forestay - I like

The first day was a bit slow with 2-3bft, we sailed to the island Houat and anchored there.
One of the pieces holding the battens in their pockets was broken and we would need to fix it somehow tomorrow.
We went ashore on Houat and found a house/bunker surrounded by old rusty cannons - call me impressed.
15kn of wind and waves during the night coming into the anchorage - went out a few times to check anchor and silence halyards flapping against the mast.

### Day 2

We tried to sail to Ile d'Yeu 50nm away. In the beginning we had 4bft and made 7-8kn, but the wind died after 20nm, so we turned around and headed for Belle Ile.
On our way we saw a school of dolphins. They swam with us for a few minutes which was very nice.
Today it was mostly the NKE auto pilot steering - works like a charm.
With lots of time to play around I figured out a way to hoist the asymmetric single-handedly, but no way to douse it alone - we don't have a furler or sock for it.
I also learned the hard way what the corners of the spinnaker are called in French: Amure - clew, ecoute: tack, drisse: head.
In the evening we anchored in the SE of Belle Ile, with less wind and waves than last night.

### Day 3

The day started with 6kn of wind. We started off to the port of Le Palais on Belle Ile, maybe we would find spare parts for the batten there.

Tying to the pontoon (shallow water so keel had to go up first) took a bit longer than expected: the harbor master tried to help us but tied us to the wrong buoy, so we had to do it all over again.
Le Palais is a beautiful little port town with more boats than cars. I bought the latest issue of [Voiles et Voilers](http://www.voilesetvoiliers.com/), something that had been on my todo list for that trip.
For the night we headed to Hoedic for, the most beautiful bay so far - and no waves (if you ever are in the region you have to see this island).
There was a little village on the island with a bar - a round of beer for us.

Cumulus clouds were stacking up on the horizon, the sunset turned everything purple, lightning in the clouds - stunning.
After sunset we sat on the boat working on the bottle of rum; we could see the Milky Way

There was a proto mini anchored right next to us, hull no. 121, "MAC"

### Day 4

We spent the whole day sailing around Quiberon Bay, made 8kn under spinnaker.
It's a crowded bay. We saw the [30m trimaran Sodebo](http://www.sodebo.fr/voile) and an IMOCA called Vestas.
We were staying in an anchorage at the north of Houat for the night, together with 10 other boats - this one was completely quiet, wave-wise.

### Day 5

We didn't really have anywhere to go so again we spent the day sailing in Quiberon and watching Sodebo and other interesting boats such as a yellow, smaller catamaran.
For the night we were staying in Port Haliguen - first shower of the trip ;)
The only open restaurant was a Crêperie with 240 different Crêpes, we were all stuffed after eating 2 each.

### Day 6

We want to do a few more miles today so we sail around Belle Île - big waves from the Atlantic welcome us, 13-20kn of wind. Top speed through water is 9.5kn under asymmetric. Looks like the Pogo always goes half as fast as the wind. For the night we again return to Hoedic.

### Day 7

We had to return the boat :( It was a quick 2h sail up the bay back to Arzon. We'll definitely be back: to sail again on this wonderful little boat, in this bay with always good wind and weather (I guess ;) ), and to anchor next to the beautiful island of Hoedic.
