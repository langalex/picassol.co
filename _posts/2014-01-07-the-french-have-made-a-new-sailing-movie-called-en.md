  The French have made a new sailing movie called [En Solitaire](http://ensolitaire-lefilm.com). In France it came out in November, here in Germany it will be released in April. It has been filmed on a real IMOCA 60 and out at sea — suddenly I'm a lot less excited about "All is lost" :D.

  P.S. they have a few [making-of videos](http://youtu.be/_Us_FhLhBzI) on YouTube.
