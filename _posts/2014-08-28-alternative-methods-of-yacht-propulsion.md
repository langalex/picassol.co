If at all possible I really want to avoid putting a stinking noisy Diesel engine into my boat, so I'm looking for alternatives.

At the moment it seems the most viable solution would be to install an electric motor, a bunch of (lithium ion) batteries with enough juice to get me in and out of marinas/anchorages plus a Diesel generator for emergencies. I know this setup still has the word Diesel in it, but a generator would be:

* Smaller and lighter – small generators only need one cylinder and need to be less powerful than engines, i.e. 2-4kw as opposed to maybe a 8-10kw engine. An engine needs to be sized for the maximum power needed, a generator only has to slowly charge the batteries. If the electric engine needs lots of power the batteries act as a buffer.
* More efficient as it could always run at optimal RPM
* Really only run when I have to motor some place too far away to get there on batteries, i.e. if sailing isn't possible
* More quiet – it's not connected to the hull like an engine is, so vibrations can be dampened more easily, plus it comes in an insulated box.

Generators have been around forever so my feeling is that shouldn't be such a big problem. Batteries, while expensive for the Amp-hour are available from multiple suppliers, too.

Electric motors are trickier. There's [Torqueedo](http://www.torqeedo.com/) but so far they only have outboards, which isn't really what you want on a yacht. I don't know if they're working on inboard engines.

There's a company in Austria called [Kräutler](http://www.kraeutler.at/bootsmotoren.html) that sells electric sail drives. Supposedly they're very expensive though and also really heavy – [this 6kw one](http://www.kraeutler.at/motor_details_de/items/14.html) is 68kg.

I was pleasantly surprised then when I read that Watt&Sea, famous producers of the Watt&Sea hydro generators (which are used a lot in IMOCAs, Open 40s and even Minis), offer motors now. Most notable is the [4kW Propulsor](http://www.wattandsea.com/en/4kw-propulsor) - maybe still a bit too weak for my purposes, but we're getting there. The cool part is how it's designed. Instead of mimicking traditional (read Diesel) engines where the engine is located inside the boat and the power is transferred to the propeller outside the boat via a shaft, they just put the whole thing into one box that hangs from the boat – pretty much like a keel. Not only does it make installation much easier (no gaping hole in the hull, no shaft), I can imagine it to be a lot less likely to break since there are fewer moving parts and everything is sealed in the box. The entire setup weighs only ~15kg.

So, since I don't need an engine just yet: Torqueedo, please work on inboard engines. Watt&Sea, please make a 6kW version.
