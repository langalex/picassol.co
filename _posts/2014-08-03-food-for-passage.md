When on an ocean passage and the waves are too high again for proper cooking, a lot of people seem to resort to cookies and pasta for their meals. Or just-add-water powders from companies like [Mountain House](http://www.mountainhouse.com/), which again are mostly pasta.

Not only isn't it much fun to eat these every day, it's also not very healthy. I've recently discovered an alternative that might be better: [Rosa Labs](http://www.rosalabs.com/) has has created [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/), a powder that contains all the nutrients you need. It probably doesn't taste better than the other powders but at least someone thought about what's good for you.

Another alternative could be [Ambronite](http://ambronite.com/), which has the same idea as Soylent but it's based on organic nuts, berries and other plants.
