:caption: The Speeddream team has posted a video of a new prototype. This one now
  has what they call a ring keel, which means it can be rotated (at least in theory)
  by 360°. This will eventually allow them to heel the boat to windward, which will
  cause the sails to help lift the boat out of the water for foiling. Can't wait to
  see that happen!
