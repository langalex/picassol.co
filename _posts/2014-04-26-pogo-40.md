Last weekend we went on our first sailing trip for 2014. Instead of going to the Mediterranean again and charter yet another Bavaria/Benetau/Jeanneau off-the-shelf boat we did things a bit differently this time: we joined a [Pogo 40](http://www.pogostructures.com/en/structures/the-early-designs/pogo-40/) race boat on the North Sea, starting Saturday in Bremerhaven, sailing to and around Helgoland and back on Monday.

Let me just start by saying that this was the best sailing experience I've ever had on a Yacht. Not only did we have between 5 and 7 bft all the time, the boat is an absolute joy to sail. We were constantly surfing between 10 and 18 knots. The boat was easy to handle and kept her course easily even when heeled quite a bit.

In this post I want to go over the differences between a racer like the Pogo 40 and a "normal" cruiser. Let's hop right into:

### The Cockpit

First of all: it's huge. At 40ft long the boat is some 4.70m wide, and that beam is maintained to almost completely aft. There are no coamings so you have the whole width – from guardrail to guardrail – for sitting and working. We were 7 people on the boat so the amount of space  came in quite handy.

Pogos come with double tiller steering. Thanks to a telescope extension you can sit back against a fender tied to the pushpit and helm from there – it doesn't get much more comfortable than that. For the rest of the crew it's usually best to sit far out to the side and lean against the guardrail. For those getting cold there's enough space for a few people to sit on the cockpit floor.

There's a gigantic cockpit locker at the transom (it's so big you have to climb down into it) which takes up all the lines and I'm sure it could fit a (deflated) dinghy and outboard as well. Our boat didn't have one. There are no lockers under the benches - that space goes to the cabins below. In front of the locker there's a pod which holds the life raft and has the main sheet block and winch attached to it.

### The Rig

Clearly a race boat rig. Everywhere you look the rig is optimized for fast sailing at the expense of making the crew work more. All the systems are very simple but effective. For example there is neither a topping lift nor a kicker. When the main goes down the boom is held (dangerously low) by the lazy jacks until you clip the main halyard to its end and use that as a topping lift. The vang is merely a strong line attached to the front and aft of the boom. To pull it down you clip another line into it, feed it through a block at the toe rail and winch it down. So much simpler than the traditional cruising system, and much more effective because it actually pulls down instead of forward to the mast.

The boom extends all the way to the transom, which is where the sheet is attached and goes down to a traveler that spans the entire width of the boat. This way you get a lot more leverage than if it was installed on the cabin top like on other boats.

The mast is made from carbon fiber but still needs a back stay. As we have a square top main make that two stays, which have to be alternated with every tack or gybe, otherwise the main's head would get caught in them. As soon as you put in at least one reef you can leave the stays though, as the head is able to slip under them. 

Our boat (very creatively named Pogo 1 by the way) had a total of four reefs. It has a two line system, i.e. a cunningham at the mast that has to be rerigged for every reef, and fixed reef lines at the leech. Working with that system was again quick and painless. I've had a lot more problems with single line systems or – god forbid – in mast furling.

At the bow the boat comes with a furling genoa, but there's also a (removable) trinquette stay for hoisting additional head sails. The stay is not a wire but a strong dyneema line that is connected to another line via a soft shackle, which allows it to be winched from the cockpit. We used it for most of our upwind sailing for which we had a sort of solent sail which would allow the boat to point higher than it would have with a (possibly furled) genoa.

Unfortunately we didn't get to use the Code 0, attached via a 2m carbon bowsprit. There was just too much wind (and not enough experienced crew). Maybe next time.

### Below deck

I guess the first word that comes to mind when stepping down below for the first time is: bare. Basically there's nothing there. No floor boards, you stand directly on the hull. No panels on the walls or the ceiling, it's all bare hull. You can actually see the sunlight shine through the GRP sometimes. While this look may not appeal to everyone it certainly saves a lot of weight (a Pogo weighs around 4.7 tons – Class 40 rules) and it makes the boat super spacious. There's a ton of stowage to the sides. On the center line there's the nav station (right in front of the stairs). In front of that the [charter company](http://sailingisland.de) added a huge fridge and table, as well as a big kitchen to starboard — a concession to the cruising trips this boat is mainly used for.

Again, to save weight, there are no doors, only curtains that let you separate the aft cabins and the head (which is part of the port cabin). The starboard aft cabin (which we slept in) is again huge, thanks to the boat's beam and the lack of furniture. Two people slept on the salon bunks, two in the front – together with all the sails and other gear :D

The only thing that did take away a bit of space were the two 750ltr ballast tanks located to either side. We didn't use them much but they can give the boat quite a bit of additional stability. The only tricky part is to get the timing right when you have to move the water to leeward before a tack – the only way to get it over is using gravity.

### Conclusion

The simplicity and resulting performance of the boat have been great fun. I'm not really sure how much I will enjoy sailing on a traditional cruiser after an experience like that. Next stop: Pogo 30 in September!
