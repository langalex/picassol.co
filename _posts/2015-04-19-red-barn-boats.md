caption: I was just roaming YouTube for more videos that would teach me bits and pieces about working with wood and boat building and stumbled upon [Red Barn Boats](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIFy7xwuKhkOuFNeWHCjyQ) and their *Building Nymph* video series. It consists of a whopping 33 videos – each being around 15 - 20 mins. long – describing in great detail each step of building a boat from plywood using the stitch and glue method. This is basically what I want to do with the Mini 650, video-wise. Great stuff.
