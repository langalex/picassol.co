title: Building my own boat?
---
It's an open secret that I'm a big fan of fast boats such as the Pogo 30 (which we will be sailing in September, yay). So when it comes to looking for potentials boats to buy, the usual suspects of cruisers are not that exciting for me. Now buying a Pogo 30 would cost at the very least €100,000, adding in a few extras it'll be more like €120,000, which is few thousands outside of the planned budget. One alternative that I've only recently really discovered and come to appreciate is building a boat myself. From what I've read so far this should allow me to shave off a few €10k from the price in exchange for a lot of hours of work – fun, gratifying work that leads to a boat that I would (literally) know inside out.

The whole thing started when I [discovered Jacques Riguidel's Solaire 34](http://picassol.co/post/90882516057/solaire-34) a few weeks ago. While I'm full of admiration for what he's doing, his method of construction didn't at all look like what I was used to from looking at the occasional photo. No frames to set up, no planking. It all looked a lot easier, more approachable than what I'd seen before.

In order to learn the basics of wooden boat building I started reading the [Boatbuilding Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Boatbuilding-Manual-Edition-Robert-Steward/dp/0071628347). It covers the old methods, which was quite complicated to read and I had to skip a few sections because I couldn't even wrap my head around those, but also touches on newer methods, namely plywood building. Making a modern plywood boat has the following significant advantages over "old" wooden boats:

Instead of building a wooden frame yourself over which you then plank the hull (very complicated), you saw a number of bulkheads out of plywood, which is a lot easier. You can even buy kits where you get them pre-cut. You then set up the bulkheads, connect them with so called stringers and then cover the whole thing with more plywood sheets. This is again easier and faster because 1st, plywood bends without steaming it first, and 2nd, plywood comes in huge sheets, so you only have to apply a few of those instead of hundreds of boards.

Bulkheads set up for [building a modern boat](http://supercarolus.nl/The_building_of_part_1.htm).

Modern boats are held together by super strong resins such as Epoxy, which is easy to apply, is stronger than the wood itself, and it can never rust. Old wooden boats were held together by nails and screws. In salt water, any metal will rust at some point (unless you use titanium all the way through maybe). Towards the end of the build you actually cover the entire wood in Epoxy, which means the wood cannot rot anymore, another problem of traditional wooden boats.

Frames for a traditional construction.

In addition to all that plywood hulls can be made extremely stiff, or stiff enough and very light weight, which brings us back to the fast boats.

In order to build a boat you need a design, which means you go to a yacht designer and buy the plans for the boat that you want. After a bit of digging on the [woodenboat.com plans & kits directory](http://www.woodenboat.com/boat-plans-kits?ssrnd=12235) I [came across the Acyd 950](http://picassol.co/post/93109040682/the-acyd-950-made-from-plywood-looks-pretty). This boat fits into the [950 class rule](http://www.classe950.com/), which was started in 2007 by the French in order to have something between the Mini 6.50 (21 feet) and the Class 40 (40 feet). Class 950 boats are 9.50m long and made for fast ocean crossings – in other words just what I'm looking for.

I went to the [designer's (AAC Group) website](http://aacdesigngroup.wix.com/acdesigngroup#!acyd-950-en/c18fi), which did not look very promising. A few renderings and some very low resolution plan overviews. I contacted them and we wrote back and forth a few times, but they haven't been very helpful so far as I had to extract every single piece of information out of them. Their approach doesn't seem to be very open and I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on their help when building a boat according to their plans.

This brought me back to Google and not long after to (drumroll) [Dudley Dix](http://dixdesign.com/). His website looks like from the early 90s, *but* it has loads and loads of information on it. He talks about every one of his designs, how to tackle specific problems during the build, links to people who've already build his designs etc. He's even [written a book on it](http://dixdesign.com/articles.htm). A completely opposite approach compared to the AAC guys. I became a fan immediately. Dix developed his own building method which he calls [radius chine plywood](http://www.dixdesign.com/radply.htm). According to him it leads to designs that are simple to build by amateurs and result in fast, lightweight boats.

To top this all off, his latest design is a Class 950, called the [Didi 950](http://www.dixdesign.com/didi950.htm). It's so new not all the details are finished yet, but 4 people are [already](http://dudleydix.blogspot.de/2014/04/didi-950-projects.html) [building](http://dudleydix.blogspot.de/2014/04/didi-950-hulls-taking-shape.html) [one](http://dudleydix.blogspot.de/2014/06/didi-950-hull-skin-completed.html). The plans only cost $1,500 (the AACs want more than 3x that) and I'm really really tempted right now....
