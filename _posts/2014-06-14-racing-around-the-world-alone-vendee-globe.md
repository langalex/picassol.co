I just watched "Racing around the World Alone", a documentary about the 2008/2009 Vendée Globe. Unfortunately the film's not very compelling. All it does is report on the progress of the race intercut with clips from the boats/skippers. 

Of course you still get a few nice images from the race, so for die-hard fans it's still watchable. Then again you can get those clips on Youtube as well. Too bad.
