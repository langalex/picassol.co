:title: An introduction to boats that goes into a few interesting details

<p>One of the essential pieces of equipment you need when going sailing is <em>drumroll</em> a boat. And for a long trip like a circumnavigation that can easily last 3 years you better buy your own. But what kind of boat? Mono or multihull, which material, new or used, big or small, slow or fast, and what can you afford?</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I’m not a boat building expert. In fact I don’t really know much about the topic at all, so don’t base any actual decisions on the following lines. Instead this post is provided purely for your reading pleasure. Many details below are taken/inspired by the fantastic book <a href="http://www.bethandevans.com/voyager's_handbook.htm">The Voyager’s handbook</a>, which I am currently reading. The rest I took from my experience, imagination and various places on the web.</p>

<p>There are a few basic requirements your boat should fulfill:</p>

<ol><li>Stability: It should not capsize and/or sink at sea. If it does capsize it should come back up again before it sinks or anyone caught below drowns, which usually means in less than two minutes. There are different ways to achieve that by choosing a boat of a certain size, displacement (weight) and hull shape.</li>
<li>Durability: It should not break. The most critical parts would be any part of the rig that could lead to the loss of the mast and every part of the hull. If the hull under the water line breaks the ship sinks, if the leak is over the water line the boat will at least take large amounts of water in heavy weather which can ultimately lead to its sinking again. Minor leaks and gear failure will not result in your premature death but contribute to your maintenance budget and discomfort so are to be avoided if possible.</li>
<li>Comfort: You should be comfortable living on board for extended periods of time. This includes enough space for you, your provisions and gear, warmth/cooling, protection from sun, salt and water, enough ventilation and only as much motion from the sea as the “weakest” crew member can bear.</li>
<li>Aesthetics/fun: Your boat must be the best looking boat on the planet. You will spend a lot of time together, go through good and bad times and put your life into her hands, so you better be very much in love with her.</li>

</ol><h2>Stability</h2>

<p>Stability determines how much force wind and sea need to apply in order to push your boat sideways onto the water. Either the wind blows so hard against the rig that it gets pushed down too far or a big wave hits and topples you over. The factors that mainly contribute to a boat’s ability to withstand these forces are hull shape and size/weight.</p>

<p>The most common type of hull is the monohull. The boat consists of a single long body, usually supported by a weighty keel at the bottom. Wind and sea pushing from the side cause the entire boat to heel to one side. The keel moves from its vertical position to a slightly more horizontal one which creates a counter force. The more the boat is heeled, the more the keel comes up and the stronger the righting moment it creates. Now to the shape part: Basically, the beamier (wider) the hull the more force is needed to push it down. Consequently a bigger boat that carries more weight (and is probably wider) is more stable than a smaller one.
Should your boat get pushed down further than 90 degrees (flat on the water) there comes a point at which the righting forces will vanish and even reverse, causing your boat to capsize completely (mast pointing down). Understandably you want to avoid that situation, but if it does happen, you want the shape of the hull to be designed in such a way that the boat comes back up rather quickly. Otherwise it will start to sink - unless you got the unsinkable upgrade.</p>

<p class="caption">Standing on your keel is obviously a stupid idea as it lessens its righting moment.</p>

<p>The second most common hull is the catamaran with two parallel bodies in the water. Catamarans do not have a keel but only rely on their shape and weight to remain upright. As they are much wider than monohulls this does indeed work - to a certain point. When wind and waves hit from the side the leeward (the one away from the wind) hull gets pushed down into the water (but never submerges completely) and the windward one gets lifted up slightly. With enough force the latter will eventually come out of the water. The further up it is lifted the smaller the horizontal distance between the bodies gets, and the weaker the boat’s righting moment becomes. When the boat is flat on the water (90 degrees) the upper hull is located exactly over the lower one and the righting moment becomes zero - for this to happen would require a crazy amount of force much higher than that needed to push a monohull on the water. A little more push and the boat capsizes with mast down - as you can imagine a capsized catamaran will not right itself up at all. The good news here is that catamarans are designed to be unsinkable, so at this point you end up with a raft with a lot of draft (height downwards the water line).</p>

<p class="caption">The raft situation you want to avoid.</p>

<p>As you can see both hull shapes have their own advantages and disadvantages. In the worst case you get to choose between temporary capsize with the option of sinking and a permanent raft. By the way, somewhere in The Book it says 9 out of 18 boats (monohulls) on a trip across the Southern Pacific trip got knocked down (&gt;=90°) at some point.</p>

<h2>Durability</h2>

<p>A boat on passage is under attack 24/7. Waves and wind push against hull and rig, salt water washes over the deck and gear and the sun’s UV rays pierce everything they can get a target on.</p>

<p>One of the big decisions that affects the durability of the overall boat is the material of the hull and deck. The major building materials are wood, GRP, steel, aluminum and carbon fiber.</p>

<p>While it has been the world’s favorite building material for centuries, even millennia, today, not many boats are made of wood anymore. When mixed with water it tends to rot - unless the boat owner applies countless layers of coating, basically all the time. There is a <a href="http://www.rm-yachts.com">french company called RM that produces boats made of plywood</a> combined with glass fiber and epoxy resin (found in the November 2012 issue of <a href="http://yachting-world.com">Yachting World</a>). They claim their boats are lighter and stronger than GRP, so if you have the extra cash you might consider them. Here's a <a href="http://www.yachtingworld.com/video/boat-tests/532843/1/rm-1260-video">video of an RM1260</a></p>

<p>For the rest of us the default choice will be GRP: it’s the cheapest boat building material which is why most boats in the cruising range are made of it. GRP stands for glass reinforced plastic and basically is a lot of glass fibers embedded in plastic. This combination happens to be a lot stronger than either of the materials on their own - welcome to the wondrous world of composite materials. The glass fiber/plastic mix is surrounded by a watertight layer of more plastic referred to as gel coat. The problem here is that if water permeates past that outer layer and into the core you get a soft, mushy material not suitable for holding a boat together at all. Unfortunately this does happen all the time, not only when the mast comes down and pierces through the deck. As the boat works its way through the sea, its hull flexes a little bit every time, forces pulling the gel coat into all directions. Over time tiny cracks develop, grow bigger, water comes in, sad face.
The second problem with GRP is that whenever you want to install some piece of gear you have to drill a bunch of holes and put an equal number of bolts through it. Your once perfectly watertight hull becomes a big piece of Swiss cheese. As you can imagine holes that are exposed to the beating of the sea will develop leaks over time, requiring constant maintenance to plug them.</p>

<p>A material that avoids that problem is steel. Instead of holes and bolts you can create an inseparable connection between two pieces of steel by means of welding them together. Unless the welder is an idiot as happened on my Atlantic crossing, where the wind steering that had been welded (well, not really) onto the stern (back) of the boat came off in the middle of the night and we reverted back to holes and bolts.
Unfortunately steel does have a big problem, and that is corrosion - you might just call it rust. As soon as you put a steel boat into the water you can pick up the paint bucket.</p>

<p>Which brings us to aluminum. It can be welded, too (although it’s more complicated, you need an aluminum welder) and does not corrode as long as you keep other types of metal away or take the necessary precaution. For more information see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis">electrolysis</a>.
Aluminum is nicer than GRP in that if there is a problem there is rust and you can see it, as opposed to hidden swamps in the hidden layers of your glassy fibers.
A property Aluminum shares with most metals and that you might want to be aware of when installing high voltage electrical devices such as a windlass (for lifting the anchor) is that it conducts electricity. You really want to make sure the insulation around those wires never comes off, unless you want to feel the unpleasant tingling of a 400V discharge.</p>

<p>The last material in our collection is carbon fiber. Its construction is similar to GRP - carbon fibers glued together with plastic, but first of all it is a lot stronger, allowing boat builders to make super light racing boats, and secondly it is crazy expensive. I love race boats and high tech materials, so after I’ve done some actual research on the topic expect a dedicated post on that.</p>

<p>In part two of the introduction to boats we’ll talk about how to create a comfortable living situation on board and the aesthetics of boats. If you have any questions or comments please use the form below.</p>
