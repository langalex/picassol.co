Sailing and sponsoring have been connected for a long time. Due to the ridiculous cost involved, especially in racing, it would be close to impossible to join something like the Vendée Globe without any sponsors. According to [this post joining the race will cost around €2.2 to 2.5 mio.](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/fr/actualites/article/977/how-much-does-it-cost-to-take-part-in-the-vendee-globe.html) – not something the average sailor can pull out of her savings account.

Is your boat on TV to show off its sponsor stickers?

Going cruising is of course much cheaper as you can make do with a much more basic boat which can also be much older. In addition you won't push her as hard which will hopefully result in lower maintenance cost. Lastly you won't have a team on land watching your every move and shipping spare parts around the world.

Still, buying a boat for some amount greater than €100,000 and then keeping her running (repairs, spare parts, new sails every now and then) is not that easy if you work a normal job. Filling the financial gap with sponsors sounds like an idea worth pursuing, but how do you do it?

I don't have an answer to that question yet (still 4 years to go), but I do have a few ideas.

First of all, what is sponsoring? The most common variation is a company giving gear or money to a sailing team. In exchange they want something from the sailor, and here it gets a bit tricky. We've all seen company logos painted onto boats and sails and clothes, but I doubt this is going to be enough today. After all, who is going to see those stickers when you spend a year cruising around some pacific islands?

The goal of a company is to sell as much as possible of their product. To attract customers they need the consumers' attention and then present themselves in a way that will make people buy - they need a brand. One thing they can do is spend tons of money on producing TV commercials where actors play out artificial stories telling us about their product. While this actually seems to have worked quite well for the past 50 years, people have become more and more numb to commercials. To overcome the problem companies have started to look for real stories with real people. This trend has been accelerated by the internet and what we now call social media. If a company were to post a generic commercial on Facebook hardly anyone would bother to click that precious like button that would carry the company's message to his friends and then their friends. What people do share is original content: photos, texts and videos from and about people who do something funny, something interesting, something extraordinary. When a company is able to piggy-back on this original content their brand and identity can spread with that content, and maybe some people will remember it the next time they buy their chewing gum.

And here is where us sailors come in: When we are out on the ocean sailing thousands of miles alone, battling storms (well, hopefully not too often), being accompanied by dolphins, visiting places few people get to see, living a life many people dream of but few ever live we have unique experiences, we do something ordinary. If we can document these experiences, this life in a way that allows companies to join, then we can offer them something pretty special for which they are willing to pay.

Be it that our [photos decorate their catalogs](http://anasaziracing.blogspot.de/2013/04/backcountrycom-web-ad-featuring.html), their outdoor products protect us from the elements (and pop up here and there in photos and videos), our blog posts end up on their Facebook pages, we review their products in the demanding context of ocean sailing, our videos become parts of their commercials, our story part of theirs – the possibilities are endless as they say. Thanks to the internet publishing is now possible from the most remote places via satellite communications. A simple laptop or tablet allows us to write, DSLR cameras have become cheap enough to let us take great pictures and video cameras like the GoPro have become small, affordable and usable so we can create videos on the go. We are not going to achieve the same quality as professional writers, photographers or film production companies, but we have better content. Those of us who acquire the skills to write, to produce photos and videos can offer potential sponsors a much better package than has ever been possible before.

I'm definitely planning to take advantage of that. This blog (which of course has a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/BluewaterProject
) and a [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/bluewaterprojct)) is only the first step. So are the thoughts and ideas in this post. Expect more in the future. And, if you consider sponsoring, it's never too early to [talk](&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%5F%40%61%6C%65%78%2E%69%6F) :)
