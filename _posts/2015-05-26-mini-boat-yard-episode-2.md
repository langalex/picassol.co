title: Mini Boat Yard Episode 2 - boat kit, saws, epoxy and lots of sanding
---

The big boat's kit has arrived in a huge 200kg box. I have decided to not open it until the dinghy is done, so that I don't have to deal with two boats at the same time.

I have coated the dinghy with another layer of epoxy. Getting the epoxy on was the easy part â€“ sanding it afterwards took forever, since I could barely use my (power) orbital sander and had to do most of the work by hand - small boat, small surfaces.

The next step was to cut the dinghy into its two parts. The [Nesting Pram](http://www.clcboats.com/shop/boats/wooden-sailboat-kits/eastport-pram/eastport-nesting-dinghy.html) is designed as two parts, which can be nested for stowage, and bolted together before putting it in the water.

Next steps are: preparing the foam floatation, and then finally start painting.
