I just stumbled across [SolarClothSystem](http://www.solarclothsystem.com/), a company who are working on embedding flexible solar cells into sails. You can either buy a new sail with the cells already laminated in or have your old sail upgraded. Or your bimini.

I wouldn't expect these cells to become my main energy source but it would sure be a nice addition to the mix, especially since they don't really take up any space on deck. A 2sqm module is said to cost around €4000.
