title: Pogo 40 trip in April
---
Yay, we just booked a 4-day trip an a [Pogo 40 ](http://www.pogostructures.com/en/structures/the-early-designs/pogo-40/) in April on [sailing island](http://www.sailingisland.de/highspeedsailing/startseite_highspeed_sailing.htm). It's only a short trip but I hope we'll have plenty of wind to try out this beautiful racer. We'll start in Bremerhaven (located at the North Sea), go around Helgoland and then back. Great preparation for [our Pogo 30 trip in September](http://picassol.co/post/73095521753/pogo-30-here-we-come) I guess :D

The Pogo 40 was introduced in 2005 with a cruising and a racing version (from what I can see we actually have the race version). Later Pogo added a separate cruising line with the 12.50.
