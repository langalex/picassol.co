Apart from looking at pictures and videos of sailing boats I spend a lot of my waking time as a programmer working on a software called [Cobot](http://cobot.me), which Coworking spaces all over the world use to manage themselves. The rest of the time I dream up apps I want to write and some have to do with sailing.

My favorite app so far is a combination of log book, blog and Twitter specific to cruising boats. Instead of people there are boats and their crews.

First it allows you to write your log book on your tablet/laptop, automatically enhancing what you write with weather and location data that it can ideally grab from the ship's GPS/compass etc. Of course you can add photos/videos and have all that published online automatically (using as little costly bandwidth as possible of course). This first set of features allows people at home to stay connected and see what you are up to on your boat. By combining the blogs of many boats it also makes it a lot easier for people like me to find interesting blogs to read.

The second feature steals the follower principle from Twitter and allows you to follow other boats. This way you can keep track of the position of friends and their boats, making it easier to meet up when it becomes apparent you are going to visit the same area.

In addition the app will have a location based section where you can see boats near you. Assuming they post local weather data it can help you with your route planning, i.e. avoiding that 72h gale or the huge crossing waves that other boat just had to go through.

Of course it doesn't stop there and I can imagine to add things like finding help for repairs, recommendations for local shops in remote areas, hence a full Facebook clone but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Not even a single line of code has been written yet.

I have other ideas, too, for example a full chart-size, e-ink based chart plotter that pretty much runs without power except for switching between charts and that you put on your chart table like a paper chart, except you only need one and it already knows your position (and in version 2 can show GRIB files).
