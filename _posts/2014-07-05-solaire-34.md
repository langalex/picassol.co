[Jacques Rigiduel](http://www.jacques-riguidel.com/) has been posting [photos of the build of his new boat](https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/44882483@N04/sets/72157637490382793/) over the last months. It's a 34ft racer made from plywood, but the outside is completely covered in fiberglass. It's been utterly fascinating for me to watch a stack of plywood turn into a beautiful boat. And he's building it all on his own.

Some people actually consider fiber enforced wood the boat building material of the future, saying the resulting structures are stronger than pure fiber. By isolating the wood from the water you probably avoid problems with rot and you also don't have to sand and varnish the entire boat every winter. I wouldn't mind trying one out :)
