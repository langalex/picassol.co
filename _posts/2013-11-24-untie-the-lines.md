While watching sailing videos on youtube I discovered [Untie the lines](https://www.youtube.com/user/WhiteSpotPirates), a weekly documentary  about a woman who just bought a 20-year-old boat in Panama and is now trying to start a solo voyage. So far she's spent all her time refitting and repairing the boat and her attempts of sailing away all ended in having to turn around. It looks like she and her boat Karl are making progress though, so I'm positive we'll see her at sea soon.
