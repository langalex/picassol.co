Like what you are seeing, want to support this project?

What I need most is contact to people that can get me materials.

* carbon fiber mast, boom, bowsprit etc.
* a set of (possibly used) sails
* natural composite materials, e.g. flax fibers

You can also [become a patron](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=752672&ty=a). I've got some cool rewards lined up, such as answering your questions on video, visiting my workshop, or even sailing with me.
